# 4-bit-LED-Binary-Counter
### This 4 bit led binary counter can also serve as a timer.
### I have wrked on basic circuits and written code that conrols leds and pretty much toggles them on and off and using the concept of binary numbers, decided to make a timer that uses the leds as an output indicating how long has gone by in seconds based on what Leds are on or off.
